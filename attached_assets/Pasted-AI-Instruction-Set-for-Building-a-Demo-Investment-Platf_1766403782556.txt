AI Instruction Set for Building a Demo Investment Platform
1️⃣ Project Setup

Initialize the project

Frontend: Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Supabase + Serverless Functions (or Node.js API)

Git repository for version control

Connect Supabase

Create a project in Supabase (free tier)

Enable:

PostgreSQL database

Authentication (email/password)

Realtime subscriptions (optional, for dashboards)

Note the SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

2️⃣ Database Design (Demo Mode)

Tables:

users

id (uuid, PK)
name (text)
email (text, unique)
password_hash (text)
created_at (timestamp)


accounts

id (uuid, PK)
user_id (uuid, FK to users)
account_type (enum: 'cash', 'investment')
balance (numeric)
is_demo (boolean) -- true for demo mode
created_at (timestamp)


transactions

id (uuid, PK)
from_account (uuid, FK to accounts)
to_account (uuid, FK to accounts)
amount (numeric)
transaction_type (enum: 'transfer', 'buy', 'sell')
status (enum: 'completed', 'failed')
is_demo (boolean)
timestamp (timestamp)


investments

id (uuid, PK)
account_id (uuid, FK to accounts)
symbol (text)
shares (numeric)
purchase_price (numeric)
current_price (numeric)
created_at (timestamp)

3️⃣ Backend Logic for Demo Transactions

Goal: Ensure transfers and buys/sells update balances and transactions like real, without using real money.

Steps for AI Implementation:

Transfer Function (demo mode)

Input: from_account_id, to_account_id, amount

Steps:

Check from_account.balance >= amount

Deduct amount from from_account.balance

Add amount to to_account.balance

Insert a record into transactions with is_demo = true

Return updated balances to frontend

Buy Investment

Input: account_id, symbol, amount

Steps:

Check account.balance >= amount

Fetch mock market price for symbol (random or from free API)

Calculate shares = amount / price

Deduct amount from account.balance

Insert/update investments table

Log transaction in transactions table with is_demo = true

Sell Investment

Input: account_id, symbol, shares

Steps:

Check investments.shares >= shares

Calculate amount = shares * current_price

Add amount to account.balance

Deduct shares from investments table

Log transaction in transactions table with is_demo = true

4️⃣ Frontend UI (Demo Mode)

Pages & Components:

Dashboard

Show cash balances, investment balances, portfolio charts

Update realtime when a demo transaction occurs

Transfer Page

Form: From Account, To Account, Amount

Submit triggers demo transfer backend function

Show updated balances + transaction confirmation

Investment Page

List available symbols (mock)

Buy/Sell forms

Show portfolio holdings

Display gains/losses charts

5️⃣ Insights for AI / Developer

Demo mode logic should be identical to real mode, except no real money is moved.

Transactions must be atomic:

Update balances and insert transactions in a single DB transaction

Prevent negative balances

Portfolio updates:

For mock data, simulate market price changes with random percentage shifts every few seconds

Frontend updates:

Use Supabase Realtime or React state to reflect transfers instantly

Future-ready design:

Keep is_demo flag; later switch to real payment API by toggling the flag

Modularize transaction functions so real money logic replaces demo logic easily

6️⃣ Suggested Free Tools

Supabase: auth, database, real-time updates

Vercel: deploy Next.js frontend and API routes

Mock market data API: Alpha Vantage free tier, IEX sandbox, or JSON files

Charting: Recharts or Chart.js for portfolio visualization

✅ Outcome:
When a user clicks “Transfer $50” or “Buy 10 shares”, your AI-powered app will update balances, record the transaction, and update charts instantly — just like a real platform — all within free tiers.
